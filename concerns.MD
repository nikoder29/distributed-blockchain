The resource is going to be the blockchain itself, whose access should be handled via mutual exclusion

1. Since the blockchain should be accessed via mutual exclusion, there should only be one ( or zero ) active socket connection on the blockchain server at any given time.

2. Should the lock be obtained only for transfer transaction ? I think it should be done for balance transaction as well.

3. the process id should be generated by the blockchain server ?

4. The connection between the server and the client , and client-all other clients should be open at all times, or should we close it once the request has been processed ?

5. We can store the details of all the clients / blockchain server on a config file.

6. The blockchain server doesn't need to know where the clients are.

7.The clients need to know each other's address as well as the server's.
